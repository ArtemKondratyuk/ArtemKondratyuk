| Soft Skills |  |  
|-----------------|--------|
|  Adaptability | I handle changes well, though I need a bit of time to adjust.  |
|  Communication | I communicate easily and naturally, with humor when appropriate; I value genuine, live interaction.  | 
|  Initiative | I notice opportunities for improvement and suggest ideas without being pushy.  |
|  Receiving Criticism | Not always pleasant, but I analyze it and extract what‚Äôs useful.  | 
|  Responsibility and Self-Organization | I put in my best effort to meet deadlines; chaos happens, but I have a system.  | 
|  Teamwork | Comfortable working in a team, especially if colleagues are supportive; solo work feels calmer.  | 
|  Motivation | I‚Äôm driven by interesting tasks, fair pay, and recognition; the balance depends on the situation.  |
